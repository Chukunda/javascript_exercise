      //       #1: Scorekeeper
      // Imagine you’re playing a game with some friends and you
      // want to keep track of the score. Create an object called
      // scores. The keys will be the names of your friends, and the
      // values will be the scores (which will all start at 0). As the
      // players earn points, you must increase their scores. How
      // would you increase a player’s score in the scores object?

      //solution
      //create a score object and the keys will be the names of your friends and values will be the scores

      let scores = {
        Jane: 0,
        Ben: 0,
        hilary: 0,
        James: 0,
      };

      alert(( scores.Jane += 1));
      alert(( scores.hilary += 5));
      alert((scores.James += 3.5));

      // Challenge 2
      //#2: Digging into Objects and Arrays
      // Say you had the following object:
      // var myCrazyObject = {
      // "name": "A ridiculous object",
      // "some array": [7, 9, { purpose: "confusion", number: 123 }, 3.3],
      // "random animal": "Banana Shark"
      // // };
      // How would you get the number 123 out of this object
      // using one line of JavaScript? Try it out in the console to see
      // if you’re right.

      // solution
      var myCrazyObject = {
        name: "A ridiculous object",
        "some array": [7, 9, { purpose: "confusion", number: 123 }, 3.3],
        "random animal": "Banana Shark",
      };

      // solution 1
      myCrazyObject["some array"][2]["number"];
      //solution 2
      let num = myCrazyObject["some array"];
      alert(num[2].number);
